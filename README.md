Here is a short video **[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdhuWDdu-rk)** that will show you how to upload your code here. Here is a [list of steps](https://education.github.com/guide/forks#3-completing-assignments) to be followed precsiely.

>
  1. At first, **fork** this repository
  2. Then **Clone** the forked repository from your account to your pc
  3. Then add all your project files and put your report in the README.md file
  4. **Push/Sync** all the changes you made to github
  5. Create a **Pull Request** on the original repository to complete submission

And here is a long video **[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73I5dRucCds)** in case you want to know more.

Before you commit your project, put your team name, name of all members and matric, project name and class section in README.md file. And put your team name in the description of the commit.

**At least one of your team member needs to have a GitHub account to be able to submit, do create an account.**

### Report

> Report
Abstract
This report is rundown of our venture of class Data Structure and Algorithm. The principle goal of this venture is that we can see how the index document seek framework is working in the PC. We likewise need to know how to actualize this idea in programming dialect.
Introduction
First of all, this group (Python) has been assigned to do a Directory File Search System project. In computing, a directory is a file system cataloging structure which contains references to other computer files, and possibly other directories. Directory file search system is about how we find a file in a computer by using it directory without using entering a long query.
It is basic in the event that we need to discover our document in the PC on the off chance that it is show on the desktop. We just essentially tap the document and it will fly up quickly. Be that as it may, we should need to seek our work which is covered up in document and covered up in the registry. It must be hard and set aside long opportunity to scan for it. So the registry record look framework empowers us to find them effortlessly. 

Overview
Basically in our project, its just a simple searching file system that prompt the user to enter the file to be search and then the system will search the file word by word until the file is found. 

Discussion
We utilize the #include library in ours. In addition, #include library empower the framework to interface with the record in the entire PC. Fundamentally in this venture, our calculation is utilizing stack, profundity first scan is a calculation for navigating or looking tree or diagram information structures. One begins at the root (selecting some self-assertive hub as the root on account of a chart) and investigates beyond what many would consider possible along every branch before backtracking
Conclusion
In conclusion, we admit that directory file search system is very important to preserve the effectiveness of computing for example in saving times and to locate every files in the system.
