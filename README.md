Major function

For this program, we decided to use object-oriented programming as this program quite a big project and thus, it is better if we can separate it function to its components rather than make it all on one file which will become hassle when we need to debug the program.
For this program, we use a few classes which each one of them have their specific function. Following is the list of the classes:
•	About Us – for display information on how to play this game
•	Welcome – for display the home page of the apps
•	Game – for displaying the level of game
•	Easy – to display game at easy level 
•	Medium – to display game at medium level
•	Hard – to display game at Hard level
•	Feedback – for player to give their suggestion about our system
