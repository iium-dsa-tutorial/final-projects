### Report

**Abstract**

This report is summary of our project of class Data Structure and Algorithm. The main objective of this project is that we can understand how the directory file search system is working in the computer. We also have to know how to implement this concept in programming language.

**Introduction**

We have been assigned into a group name TIKITAKA to do a project entitled Directory File Search System. Directory file search system is about how we find a file in a computer by using it directory without using entering a long query. 

It is simple if we want to find our file in the computer if it is display on the desktop. We just simply click the file and it will pop up immediately. But, how about we want to search our work which is hidden in file and hidden in the directory. It must be hard and take long time to search for it. So the directory file search system enables us to locate them easily.

Meanwhile regular expression is another feature of directory file search system which is a special text string for describing a search pattern. Example, you can type wildcard notation such as *.txt to find all text files in a file manager.

**Overview  of project**

Basically  in our project, we divide the type of features into two modes which is normal mode and regex mode. Normal mode is like we search using general query such as png text, and so on.
But regex mode feature is about how to difference between words that match the regex and words that don’t. For example wejust type the query “(.*).png” for identifying the exact file that have those letters.

**Discussion**

We use the #include<regex> library in our project so that it will enable the regex mode feature. Besides, #include<dirent.h> library enable the system to connect with the document in the whole computer. Basically in this project , our algorithm is using stack, depth first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. One starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion directory file search system is important in computer system in order to save time to locate each of every file exist.
