## Family Tree Project
Family tree, or pedigree chart, is a chart representing family relationships in a conventional tree structure. Family trees are often presented with the oldest generations at the top and the newer generations at the bottom. 

## The Explaination of Algorithms
Based on our project, we use object to obtain information from the users to add new member. Then, we also put object inside array using push function. Furthermore, the input that users enter we store in local storage. 

## The Description of All Major Functions/Classes
* We use function _saveFamilytoStorage()_ to store the data into the local storage. 
*	Next is function _viewFamily()_ that will display all information in the local storage.
*	Then, function _findMember()_ is to find member according to particular question that user choose.

## The Details of The Data Storage Scheme
In our project we use local storage. The use of localStorage is to store data locally within userâ€™s browser. The limit for local storage is far larger at least 5MB. All pages, from one origin, can store and access the same data. The local storage object stores the data with no expiration date. In addition, the data will not be deleted even when the browser is closed.

## The Format of the Accepted Questions to the System
Our system can find relative in the family two steps above. The formats are:

1.	Who is your grandfather?
2.	Who is your grandmother?
3.	Who is your father?
4.	Who is your mother?
5.	Who is your siblings?
