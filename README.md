Here is a short video **[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdhuWDdu-rk)** that will show you how to upload your code here. Here is a [list of steps](https://education.github.com/guide/forks#3-completing-assignments) to be followed precsiely.

>
  1. At first, **fork** this repository
  2. Then **Clone** the forked repository from your account to your pc
  3. Then add all your project files and put your report in the README.md file
  4. **Push/Sync** all the changes you made to github
  5. Create a **Pull Request** on the original repository to complete submission

And here is a long video **[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73I5dRucCds)** in case you want to know more.

Before you commit your project, put your team name, name of all members and matric, project name and class section in README.md file. And put your team name in the description of the commit.

**At least one of your team member needs to have a GitHub account to be able to submit, do create an account.**

### Report

> AbstractScientific calculator is one of the useful thing that created to solve basic nor complex mathematic calculations. Developing it on computer can be useful to user as they can open the program to solve complex mathematic calculations. Creating the algorithms for each features of the calculator is one of biggest challenges developing this program. Applying the system learned from “Data Structure and Algorithm” help us solve to the problems. IntroductionCalculator is a portable electronic device used to perform operations ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics. Computer operating systems as far as early Unix have included interactive calculator programs such as dc and hoc, and calculator functions are included in almost all personal digital assistant type devices.In addition to general purposes calculators, there are those designed for specific markets. For example, there are scientific calculators which include trigonometric and statistical calculations.Scientific calculator does have more functions than the basic calculator. It was included with features such as scientific notation, floating point arithmetic, logarithmic functions, trigonometric functions and exponential functions.In this project, we develop a calculator program that works similarly like scientific calculator. This program also will be included with basic functions of calculator which are addition, subtraction, divide and multiply. In addition, we also include logarithmic functions, trigonometric functions and exponential functions to the program.ChallengesThe main challenge for this program is to generate the scientific function as the programming language using the default for the calculation. So, in order to solve this problem, one of our group members, suggested to encode the text file to UTF-8. Secondly, for the user interface, all the methods, buttons, and text input are put in a class. It is quite impossible to separate all the items into different classes .Last but not least, the understanding of the programming knowledge among us is quite limited and it is basis for those whom taking programming or computer-related subject. That was one of the reason we included try and catch exception in this program.ConclusionAs conclusion, we learned a lot of things by doing this scientific calculator and we hope this program can solve and improve user life efficiently.
