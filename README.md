## Final Projects
----
#### This is where all of you needs to submit your source code and report.
----

Here is a short video **[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdhuWDdu-rk)** that will show you how to upload your code here. Here is a [list of steps](https://education.github.com/guide/forks#3-completing-assignments) to be followed precsiely.

>
  1. At first, **fork** this repository
  2. Then **Clone** the forked repository from your account to your pc
  3. Then add all your project files and put your report in the README.md file
  4. **Push/Sync** all the changes you made to github
  5. Create a **Pull Request** on the original repository to complete submission

And here is a long video **[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73I5dRucCds)** in case you want to know more.

Before you commit your project, put your team name, name of all members and matric, project name and class section in README.md file. And put your team name in the description of the commit.

**At least one of your team member needs to have a GitHub account to be able to submit, do create an account.**

> Bring the [[DSA Project: Group Assessment.pdf](https://github.com/iium-dsa-tutorial/final-projects/blob/master/DSA%20Project-Group%20Assessment.pdf )] document with you in the presentation.

Extra features
-	Can set the size of the rectangle
-	Can set the time of the program whether fast or slow by default, quick sort is fast
-	The visualization is inverted, unique and have some error but still can generate.
-	Our QuickSort in only for ascending order.
Explaination of the algorithm
-	Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a less-than relation (formally, a total order) is defined. In efficient implementations it is not a stable sort, meaning that the relative order of equal sort items is not preserved. Quicksort can operate in-place on an array, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.

Description of all major functions/class
Main function 
?	Set size of the window
?	Insert value by using random number , the number can be variable
?	Function sorterThread start () is called in the main
                 Array Component Class
?	Initialized two double and array of double
?	Paint component function to set the rectangle height and determine which rectangle should be coloured at a time. 

Sorter Class
?	Initialized one double name values and one ArrayComponent panel
?	Run function initialized one constructor named comp
?	Function compare takes two double value and return the lowest
?	Collection sort the values according to ascending values. 


Detail about partition algorithm used
-	We pick random pivot value, the smaller value will go to the left, the higher value will go the right, we choose 20 bar.
-	Will repeat if there is smaller value than pivot value and this will sort according to value.
Implementation (details how to approach)
-	We use java language to implement the GUI because java has build in library to create GUI and function to execute the GUI
-	We set the number of bar and time so that we can visualize in big number and also slow time because our sort is the fastest and efficient.
