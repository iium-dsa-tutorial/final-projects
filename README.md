#### This is where all of you needs to submit your source code and report.
----

Here is a short video **[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdhuWDdu-rk)** that will show you how to upload your code here. Here is a [list of steps](https://education.github.com/guide/forks#3-completing-assignments) to be followed precsiely.

>
  1. At first, **fork** this repository
  2. Then **Clone** the forked repository from your account to your pc
  3. Then add all your project files and put your report in the README.md file
  4. **Push/Sync** all the changes you made to github
  5. Create a **Pull Request** on the original repository to complete submission

And here is a long video **[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73I5dRucCds)** in case you want to know more.

Before you commit your project, put your team name, name of all members and matric, project name and class section in README.md file. And put your team name in the description of the commit.

**At least one of your team member needs to have a GitHub account to be able to submit, do create an account.**

> Bring the [[DSA Project: Group Assessment.pdf](https://github.com/iium-dsa-tutorial/final-projects/blob/master/DSA%20Project-Group%20Assessment.pdf )] document with you in the presentation.

Project Report:

	INTRODUCTION

In this project, our group aims to develop source code in the form of a computer program that could be used in a scientific calculator to compute functions such as square root, sine cos tan function and etc. Since all mathematical function are define in library, so we have return the value of the function to call function. We also use switch-case statement and a do-while loop to keep the program running until user stop it.
This code compromise of one class that is scientific calculator. This class will help to perform all sixteen calculations. It also contain static function to ensure that these function can be called in main function through class name.

LOGIC OF PROGRAMME

1.	Adding two number
2.	Subtracting the second number from the first number
3.	Multiplying two number
4.	Dividing first number from second
5.	Modulus of first number by second number
6.	Determine square of the number
7.	Determine the cube of the number
8.	Determine square root of the number
9.	Determine first number power of second number
10.	Determine the factorial of a number.
11.	Determine the sin, cos and tan value of a number
12.	Determine the logarithm, natural logarithm and exponential of a   number.
