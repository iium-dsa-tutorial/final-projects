FEATURES

In this project, the system works as a file search system which can display, create, clear the searching 
box and search files or folders. It will only display the file and folder creates by the user. If the
 user creates a new file or folder, it will be added into the system and he has to choose either to 
save as file or folder. When the user wants to search the file or folder, he needs to enter the exact 
name of the file or folder if not the system will send an error message of “Data not found!” to aware 
the user about his mistakes. Then he needs to enter the “Search file” button to search the file and 
enter the “Search folder” button to search folder.  The function of the “Clear” button is to clear 
all the data that appeared when the user search the file or the folder. 

ALGORITHM

For this system, the basic approach to search is to simply visit every file and folder in a certain 
location one-by-one whenever a search is performed. The idea is that when the searching of files is 
performed, it will list all the files that have the exact names. The file or folder create by the 
user will be stored in an array. The array is used to store a collection of data, and consist of 
contiguous memory locations. In this system, an empty array is created. The function of the array
is when the user created a new file or folder, it will displayed next after the file or folder had 
created before. This system’s has a steady growth since it yields big O(N). Its performance will grow 
linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input of data set. It will take less time to 
execute the codes for searching the files or folders in the system since it used big O(N).


MAJOR CLASSES
1)	Search()
-	the class contains the input that we search
2)	GUIAddFile()
-	the class contains all the features that this system has
-	it is the interface of the system
3)	Folder()
-	the class is inheritance from the search class if the user asked to search about the folder
4)	FolderArray()
-	the class will add any created folder that they user key in
-	it will show the folder the user search
5)	File()
-	the class is inheritance from the search class if the user asked to search the files
6)	FileArray()
-	the class will show the file that the user search.
-	It will add every file that they created 

MAJOR FUNCTIONS
1)	private static void increaseSize ()
-	to increase the size of the folder or file that the user created
2)	public String display()
-	to display all the file or the folder that the user try to search
3)	private void initialize()
-	the function initializes the folder or the file search
-	it will save the new folder/file that the user created
-	the searching of the folder or the file is not case sensitive

PATTER MATCHING
-the folder or the file must be search using the complete name
